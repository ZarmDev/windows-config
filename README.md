# windows-config
A script that lets you easily optimize your operating system for performance and battery usage.

I have tested it and it does not brick your computer or do any other changes like that, but it could break some programs and features

**I added inputs for some feature disabling and there is a comment FOR EVERY SINGLE CHANGE it makes**

If you are scared about running it, just look at the C++ file and that's it.

I am not responsible for any damage on your PC.

# How to run it
Use visual studio and open the .sln file or download the exe in the releases tab

I may have not uploaded the most recent release
